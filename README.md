# Notochord

Notochord is a lead-sheet editor and chord player inspired by iReal Pro. It's still in development so expect bugs and missing functionality. Check out [the demo](https://notochord.github.io/notochord/demo/).

## Repos

* This one - ties all the bits together
* [percussion-soundfont.js](https://github.com/notochord/percussion-soundfont.js) is a set of drum sounds
* More to come when I get bits working better...

## Credit

* This uses the awesome package [Tonal](https://github.com/danigb/tonal) to handle the Theory math.
* Various symbols adapted from images from Wikimedia Commons (all are in the public domain):
   * [Musical symbols](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_musical_notation)
   * [Delta](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Greek_uc_delta.svg)
* Uses [soundfont-player](https://github.com/danigb/soundfont-player) to play the sounds.
   * Uses the good old [MIDI.js soundfonts](https://github.com/gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts) for most instruments
   * Drum sounds are in [this repo](https://github.com/notochord/percussion-soundfont.js) but stolen from [this repo](https://github.com/letoribo/General-MIDI-Percussion-soundfonts-for-MIDI.js-) which adapted them from [here](http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php). :sweat_smile:
