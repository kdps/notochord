# Oligophony

A lead-sheet editor and chord player a la iReal (which you should buy because
it's far more useful and you should support the arts and stuff).

This is like _super_ modular and excessively well-documented. A friend of mine
recently complained that I don't comment enough so **TAKE THAT MAX**

## Modules
* **oligophony.js** - A system for storing and manipulating song/chord data
* **viewer.js** - Displays an Oligophony as a pretty SVG
* **editor.js** (doesn't exist yet) - extends viewer.js to be interactive
* **player.js** (doesn't exist yet) - plays chords from an Oligophony
